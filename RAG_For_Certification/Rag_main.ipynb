      "A Generative Al Engineer has created a RAG application to look up answers to questions about a series of fantasy novels that are being asked on the author’s web forum. The fantasy novel texts are chunked and embedded into a vector store with metadata (page number, chapter number, book title), retrieved with the user’s query, and provided to an LLM for response generation. The Generative AI Engineer used their intuition to pick the chunking strategy and associated configurations but now wants to more methodically choose the best values.\n",
      "Which TWO strategies should the Generative AI Engineer take to optimize their chunking strategy and parameters? (Choose two.)\n",

      "\n",
      "Option 1:\n",
      "Change embedding models and compare performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 2:\n",
      "Add a classifier for user queries that predicts which book will best contain the answer. Use this to filter retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 3:\n",
      "Choose an appropriate evaluation metric (such as recall or NDCG) and experiment with changes in the chunking strategy, such as splitting chunks by paragraphs or chapters. Choose the strategy that gives the best performance metric.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 4:\n",
      "Pass known questions and best answers to an LLM and instruct the LLM to provide the best token count. Use a summary statistic (mean, median, etc.) of the best token counts to choose chunk size.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 5:\n",

      "Explanation:\n",
      "Explanation for Right Options:\n",
      "Option 3:\n",

      "Explanation: This option suggests using evaluation metrics like recall or NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) to assess how well different chunking strategies retrieve relevant information. By experimenting with chunking strategies (e.g., splitting by paragraphs or chapters), the engineer can identify which configuration maximizes the chosen metric.\n",
      "Justification: This method is systematic and data-driven, ensuring that the chunking strategy is optimized based on objective performance measures rather than intuition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 5:\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation: This approach involves using an LLM-as-a-judge metric to evaluate the quality of responses generated from different chunking strategies. By comparing how well each chunk answers previous questions, the engineer can fine-tune the chunking parameters to improve overall retrieval and response accuracy.\n",
      "Justification: This strategy leverages the capabilities of LLMs to assess content relevance and accuracy, providing a practical way to optimize chunking parameters based on real-world performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation for Wrong Options:\n",
      "Option 1:\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation: Changing embedding models and comparing performance focuses on the embeddings themselves rather than the chunking strategy.\n",
      "Justification: The question is about optimizing chunking strategy and parameters, not about experimenting with different embedding models. While important, this option doesn't directly address the chunking strategy optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 2:\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation: Adding a classifier to predict which book might contain the answer is about improving the retrieval process but not specifically related to optimizing chunk sizes or strategies.\n",
      "Justification: This option introduces a different layer of filtering but does not focus on the core issue of chunking strategy optimization, which is the main concern of the engineer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option 4:\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation: This option involves using LLMs to predict optimal token counts for chunks based on known questions and answers.\n",
      "Justification: While this could help in choosing chunk sizes, it relies on token count as a heuristic rather than performance metrics like recall or NDCG. It’s less methodical and may not yield the best performance in terms of information retrieval and relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "The best strategies for optimizing the chunking strategy and parameters involve using evaluation metrics (Option 3) and leveraging LLM-based assessments (Option 5). \n",
      "These methods provide systematic and data-driven approaches to fine-tuning the chunking process, ensuring the highest possible performance for retrieving relevant information. \n",

    "You are an AI-powered Q&A assistant designed to answer questions related to Generative AI engineering, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Databricks features, and related technical topics.  \n",
    "Your primary knowledge source is a text-based dataset containing question-answer pairs, explanations, and summaries related to AI engineering concepts.  \n",
    "You are integrated within a Semantic Kernel framework that retrieves relevant chunks of data using semantic search and passes them to you for reasoning and response generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "- You operate as part of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.\n",
    "- Your retrieved context will come from pre-processed text documents containing multiple-choice questions, answers, explanations, and summaries.\n",
    "- If the relevant information is not found in the knowledge base, you may use your general knowledge of Databricks, LLMs, and RAG systems to infer an accurate response.\n",
    "- Your answers must be concise and formatted in an exam-style tone—clear, direct, and to the point.\n",
    "- You should not cite metadata such as question numbers, difficulty levels, or skill sections in responses.\n",
    "- When external information is used, it should align with Databricks documentation and modern AI engineering practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. Read the user’s question carefully.\n",
    "2. Review the retrieved text chunks from the knowledge base.\n",
    "3. Extract the most relevant facts, reasoning steps, and conclusions from the retrieved context.\n",
    "4. Generate a concise, exam-style answer that directly addresses the user’s query.\n",
    "5. If the answer is not explicitly found in the provided context:\n",
    "   - Use general knowledge and reasoning.\n",
    "   - Reference conceptual guidance consistent with Databricks official documentation and standard RAG methodologies.\n",
    "6. Avoid unnecessary elaboration or background information unless it directly clarifies the answer.\n",
    "7. Do not mention metadata fields (e.g., “Skill Section,” “Difficulty,” “Guideline Time”).\n",
    "8. Never state that the answer was “not found.” Instead, provide the best possible inference based on relevant principles.\n",
    "9. Maintain factual accuracy and professional tone throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "- Semantic Kernel framework for retrieval and orchestration.\n",
    "- Vector store for semantic document search.\n",
    "- Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning and answer generation.\n",
    "- Databricks documentation as an external reference for general knowledge fallback.\n",

    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "**User Input:**  \n",
    "“What are two methods to optimize the chunking strategy in a RAG pipeline?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output:**  \n",
    "Use evaluation metrics like recall or NDCG to compare chunking strategies, and apply an LLM-based evaluation to judge response relevance. These approaches provide data-driven and qualitative optimization of chunk parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "**User Input:**  \n",
    "“How should a Generative AI Engineer design a RAG application for answering technical regulation queries?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output:**  \n",
    "Ingest and index documents into vector search, allow the LLM to retrieve relevant content, generate responses, evaluate performance, and deploy using model serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3\n",
    "**User Input:**  \n",
    "“What Databricks feature can log requests and responses in model serving?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output:**  \n",
    "Use Inference Tables to automatically capture and log incoming requests and outgoing responses for model monitoring and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)\n",
    "1. Receive the user’s query.\n",
    "2. Retrieve the most relevant context chunks using semantic search.\n",
    "3. Summarize and synthesize the retrieved information.\n",
    "4. Generate a precise, exam-style answer using:\n",
    "   - Retrieved content if relevant.\n",
    "   - Databricks and LLM general knowledge if missing.\n",
    "5. Return the answer without metadata or references.\n",
    "6. Maintain consistency, factual accuracy, and brevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Notes\n",
    "- The RAG assistant should emulate a subject-matter expert providing quick, correct, and concise answers.\n",
    "- Always prioritize correctness, clarity, and conciseness.\n",
    "- Default to authoritative Databricks or Generative AI best practices when context is insufficient.\n",
    "- Avoid speculation or verbose explanations unless necessary for clarity.\n",
