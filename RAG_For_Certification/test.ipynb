      "There's a few things to note here which can impact both the performance and the quality of\n",
      "the chat completion:\n",
      "1. Verbosity of function schema – Serializing functions for the model to use doesn't come\n",
      "for free. The more verbose the schema, the more tokens the model has to process, which\n",
      "can slow down the response time and increase costs.\n",
      "2. Parameter types – With the schema, you can specify the type of each parameter. This is\n",
      "important for the model to understand the expected input. In the above example, the\n",
      "size  parameter is an enum, and the toppings  parameter is an array of enums. This helps\n",
      "the model generate more accurate responses.\n",
      "3. Required parameters - You can also specify which parameters are required. This is\n",
      "important for the model to understand which parameters are actually necessary for the\n",
      "function to work. Later on in Step 3, the model will use this information to provide as\n",
      "minimal information as necessary to call the function.\n",
      " Tip\n",
      "Keep your functions as simple as possible. In the above example, you'll notice that\n",
      "not all functions have descriptions where the function name is self-explanatory. This\n",
      "is intentional to reduce the number of tokens. The parameters are also kept simple;\n",
      "anything the model shouldn't need to know (like the cartId  or paymentId ) are kept\n",
      "hidden. This information is instead provided by internal services.\n",
      "７ Note\n",
      "The one thing you don't need to worry about is the complexity of the return types.\n",
      "You'll notice that the return types are not serialized in the schema. This is because\n",
      "the model doesn't need to know the return type to generate a response. In Step 6,\n",
      "however, we'll see how overly verbose return types can impact the quality of the chat\n",
      "completion.\n",
      " Tip\n",
      "Avoid, where possible, using string  as a parameter type. The model can't infer the\n",
      "type of string, which can lead to ambiguous responses. Instead, use enums or other\n",
      "types (e.g., int , float , and complex types) where possible.\n",
      "4. Function descriptions – Function descriptions are optional but can help the model\n",
      "generate more accurate responses. In particular, descriptions can tell the model what to\n",
      "expect from the response since the return type is not serialized in the schema. If the\n",
      "model is using functions improperly, you can also add descriptions to provide examples\n",
      "and guidance.\n",
      "For example, in the get_pizza_from_cart  function, the description tells the user to use this\n",
      "function instead of relying on previous messages. This is important because the cart may\n",
      "have changed since the last message.\n",
      "5. Plugin name – As you can see in the serialized functions, each function has a name\n",
      "property. Semantic Kernel uses the plugin name to namespace the functions. This is\n",
      "important because it allows you to have multiple plugins with functions of the same\n",
      "name. For example, you may have plugins for multiple search services, each with their\n",
      "own search  function. By namespacing the functions, you can avoid conflicts and make it\n",
      "easier for the model to understand which function to call.\n",
      "Knowing this, you should choose a plugin name that is unique and descriptive. In the\n",
      "above example, the plugin name is OrderPizza . This makes it clear that the functions are\n",
      "related to ordering pizza.\n",
      " Tip\n",
      "Only mark parameters as required if they are actually required. This helps the model\n",
      "call functions more quickly and accurately.\n",
      " Tip\n",
      "Before adding a description, ask yourself if the model needs this information to\n",
      "generate a response. If not, consider leaving it out to reduce verbosity. You can\n",
      "always add descriptions later if the model is struggling to use the function properly.\n",
      " Tip\n",
      "When choosing a plugin name, we recommend removing superfluous words like\n",
      "\"plugin\" or \"service\". This helps reduce verbosity and makes the plugin name easier\n",
      "to understand for the model.\n",
      "７ Note\n",
      "Once the functions are serialized, they are sent to the model along with the current chat\n",
      "history. This allows the model to understand the context of the conversation and the available\n",
      "functions.\n",
      "In this scenario, we can imagine the user asking the assistant to add a pizza to their cart:\n",
      "C#\n",

      "Once Semantic Kernel has the correct types, it can finally invoke the add_pizza_to_cart\n",
